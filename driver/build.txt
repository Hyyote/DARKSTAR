Prerequisites:
  - Visual Studio 2022 with "Desktop development with C++" workload
  - Windows Driver Kit (WDK) for Visual Studio 2022
  - Install WDK from: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk

Build steps:
  1. Open "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt"
  2. cd path\to\driver
  3. type in: BUILD_MANUAL.bat

Output:
  x64\Release\DarkstarDriver.sys

If the build succeeds but produces NO .sys file:
  - Ensure WDK is installed (not just the SDK)
  - Check that WindowsKernelModeDriver10.0 toolset exists in your VS installation
  - Try: msbuild DarkstarDriver.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64 /t:Rebuild /v:detailed
